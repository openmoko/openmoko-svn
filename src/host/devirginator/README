Devirginator
============

This collection of scripts initializes a "virgin" device. It erases the
NAND and installs u-boot, the Linux kernel, and the root file system.


Quick start
===========

First,
% cp config.example config
and may changes as needed. In particular, you must set SNAPSHOT.
Then
% make
This requires Netpbm and transfig. Finally, make sure that openocd runs,
power the device up, become root, and run
# ./devirginate


Prerequisites
=============

The device must be connected to:

- JTAG, with an interface supported by OpenOCD (required for all stages)
- USB, connected to the machine running "devirginate" (only required for
  stage 2 and beyond)

Furthermore, if a serial console is connected to the device, installation
progress can be monitored.

The following programs are needed:

- dfu-util must be accessible from the machine running "devirginate".
  If dfu-util is not in PATH, you can set an explicit path in "config".

  
  To build dfu-util, do this:
  cd $OMDIR/openmoko/trunk/src/host/dfu-util
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make

- OpenOCD. SVN revision 130 with libftdi 0.8 is known to work. Other
  combinations may also work. The following patch is required:
  SVN: developers/werner/openocd-wait-patiently.patch

  For build instructions, see developers/werner/notes/openocd

  If you're using the version of OpenOCD built by the OpenMoko
  distribution (SVN revision 1180 or later), the patch is already
  applied.

Furthermore, "devirginate" requires telnet.

"setup.sh" can be run from a different machine sharing the same file
system hierarchy. It requires Netpbm, transfig, wget, and Perl.


Setup
=====

The devirginator first needs to be set up. This includes

- downloading binaries for u-boot, kernel, etc.
- generating/converting various files used during the setup process

At the moment, the setup must be done in the directory containing all
files belonging to the devirginator. The files generated during setup
are stored in the directory tmp/. The files in tmp/ are also used
during devirgination.

First, copy config.example to "config" and make the necessary changes.
Almost all settings have reasonable defaults, but the least thing you
will have to do is set SNAPSHOT to the date code of the snapshot you
desire.

Next, run either  ./setup.sh  or just  make .

setup.sh will now download any missing files, and perform the various
conversions. If any error occur during this, e.g., because of missing
tools or a configuration error, setup.sh will stop with an error. You
then have to correct the problem and retry. Files already downloaded
to tmp/ will be skipped in the retry (setup.sh will still probe if
they have changed).

setup.sh also checks if executables used during devirgination are
available and prints a warning if it finds anything missing. In general,
one can run setup.sh on a different machine than "devirginate", in
which case these warnings can be ignored.


Files
=====


Scripts
-------

- crc32.pl
  Provides the function crc32, which computes the IEEE CRC-32.
  This script is used by other Perl scripts, with "do".

- envedit.pl
- openocdcmd.pl
- scriptify.pl
- setup.sh

User configuration
------------------

Static configuration files
--------------------------

The following files contain scripts and other "static" configuration
information that is used in the devirgination process. In general,
it is only necessary to edit these files when changing functionality
of the setup process.

Each of these files is converted in some way by setup.sh. Below, we
indicate the name of the respective resulting file after the arrow.

- openocd.in -> tmp/script.ocd
  Commands to execute by OpenOCD in phase 0. To perform variable
  expansion, each line of this file is processed by the shell with
  eval "echo $line". Due to this, shell meta-characters should be
  avoided.

  If changing any addresses in openocd.in, you also need to update
  u-boot.in.

- u-boot.in -> tmp/u-boot.out
  Commands to execute in u-boot during stage 0. This file is converted
  to an image understood by u-boot, and then executed from memory with
  u-boot's "autoscr" command.

- environment.in -> tmp/environment
  Environment settings for the regular u-boot environment. Note that
  the changes in this file are made on top of the interim environment
  produced in stage 0. In particular, the "mtdparts" variable is
  retained from that stage.

  Long lines can be split in environment.in by simply indenting the
  continuation. Note that the newline and the indentation are replaced
  with one space. E.g.,
  foo=some
    thing
  would yield  foo=some thing

- smiley.fig -> tmp/smiley.gz
  The stage 0 splash screen, a smiling face on a green background.


Download cache
--------------

- tmp/System_boot.png -> tmp/splash.gz
  This is a copy of the OpenMoko logo, which then gets converted to a
  gzip-ed raw framebuffer image.

- tmp/openmoko-devel-image-*.rootfs.jffs2
- tmp/lowlevel_foo-*.bin
- tmp/u-boot-*.bin
- tmp/uImage-*.bin

- tmp/env.old
- tmp/env.new
- tmp/preboot_override
- tmp/preboot_override.noscrub
- tmp/preboot_override.scrub


Scripts
-------



The first few messages should look like this:
Open On-Chip Debugger
> script /home/moko/om/trunk/src/host/devirginator/tmp/script.ocd
reset halt
wait_halt
waiting for target halted...
Target 0 halted
target halted in ARM state due to debug request, current mode: Supervisor
cpsr: 0x400000d3 pc: 0x00000000
[...]

The "pc: 0x00000000" is important. If the number is different, e.g.,
something like "pc: 0xffffffed", the device is probably not turned
on. In this case, you can try to restart, or, if openocd is stuck,

- kill openocd
- pull and then replace the USB plug of the JTAGkey or debug v2 board
- start openocd


Stages
======

The setup process is divided into three stages (plus a special zero
stage, see below). Each stage leaves the device in a stable state.
An installation run can include all or only some stages. Each stage
requires successful completion of all previous ones.

Stage 1: erases all previous NAND content, installs u-boot, and makes
  the device ready to receive further updates by DFU.
Stage 2: installs Linux and the root file system.
Stage 3: To be defined.

Note that you most likely require privileges for some of the USB
operations "devirginate" performs. Therefore, do all this as "root".

To perform all stages, run
# ./devirginate
from the trunk/src/host/devirginator/ directory.

To run only individual stages, specify the stage numbers, each prefixed
by "-", e.g.,
# ./devirginate -1


Stage 0
-------

If the NAND bad block table is invalid, it can be erased at the beginning
of stage 1. We call this "stage 0".

In general, this is not a desirable option, because if the last NAND blocks
are defective, this information will be lost, and unreliable operation may
result. By default, stage 0 is not performed.


Stage 1
-------

Immediately after starting, the screen lights up, showing random junk.
This is an indication that the setup process has started. Note that the
screen content may change ("decay") during all this. This is normal.

After 10-30 seconds, the screen will go dark. This indicates that we
now a have u-boot running on the device.

About 60-90 seconds later, the screen will light up again and show a
smiling face on a green background. This indicates that the first stage
has completed. The smiling face will appear each time you activate the
device.

The device now contains:
- a bad block table (BBT)
- u-boot, with DFU capability
- a basic set of u-boot environment variables
- the interim splash screen

What is still missing:
- the Linux kernel
- the root file system
- the final environment
- the final splash screen


Stage 2
-------

To begin phase 2, activate the device. The stage 1 smiley will show.

Phase 2 can take several minutes. Progress of the download procedure
is indicated by hash signs (#) printed on the terminal where
"devirginate" runs.

At the end of phase 2, the device resets, displays a partial OpenMoko
splash screen, then resets again, displays the correct splash screen
and finally boots Linux.


Stage 3
-------

TBD.
